Very Cool Gold Bar Tracker that now tracks Sands and custom stuff also.

Don't judge my coding, I learnt Python just to make this app :)
Big thanks to Monbanz for helping me create this.

Let me know if you find any bugs or have suggestions.

App is set to Always be on Top.
I may or may not add a toggle for this in the future.

Change the files in the img folder if you'd like to customise the app icons.
The program will automatically resize them but if you'd like to do it manually, the large icons are 50x50px and the small icons are 25x25px.
Images MUST be .png files.

If updating from a previous version, replace the data.json file in the zip with your old data.json file.

---------------

Go to the latest release on the sidebar and download the zip file for the compiled .exe files for Windows users.

Launch tracker.exe and change theme in settings tab. By default it will be in dark mode.

INSTRUCTIONS:
